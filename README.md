## Austin Hangouts

This is a project containing an inventory of places to eat, drink, and hang out in Austin, Texas, with rankings and other info. It is built using Node, Express, and MongoDB. It will serve up date and, eventually, via a front-end app, will allow a user to perform classic CRUD operations on the data.

The project was set up from Olatunde Garuba's very helpful tutorial [Build Node.js RESTful APIs in 10 Minutes](https://www.codementor.io/olatundegaruba/nodejs-restful-apis-in-10-minutes-q0sgsfhbd).
